# My undergraduate final project in 2016 - Haircutter

This project is an application for finding, evaluating and scheduling hair stylists services.

It was developed using tecnologies like Java 8, Spring Boot, AngularJs.

We had a short time for study and development, so we dont have unit tests.

I'll try to adapt this project to Heroku App to show it for you.

The front-end files is in /haircutter-admin/src/main/resources/templates/
